# Volunteer Network is a full-stack project with a real time database where different volunteering works are shown.
# User on this website can select those volunteering works and can register himself as a part of the particular volunteering work.
# Besides, this project provides an admin dashboard where an admin can manage user registered volunteering works and also can add new work in the database.
